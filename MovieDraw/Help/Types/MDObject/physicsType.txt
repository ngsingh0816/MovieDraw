<desc>The way to handle physics collisions. A value of MD_OBJECT_PHYSICS_EXACT means that the collisions will happen when something collides with this object exactly. A value of MD_OBJECT_PHYSICS_BOUNDINGBOX means that collisions will happen when something collides with the object's bounding box. A value of MD_OBJECT_PHYSICS_BOUNDINGSPHERE means that collisions will happen when something collides with the object's bounding sphere. A value of MD_OBJECT_PHYSICS_CYLINDER_X means that collisions will happen when something collides with the object's bounding clyinder that is symmetrical over the x axis. A value of MD_OBJECT_PHYSICS_CYLINDER_Y means that collisions will happen when something collides with the object's bounding clyinder that is symmetrical over the y axis. A value of MD_OBJECT_PHYSICS_CYLINDER_Z means that collisions will happen when something collides with the object's bounding clyinder that is symmetrical over the z axis.</desc>
<example>
MDObject* obj = //...
// Get the value
unsigned char value = obj.physicsType;
// Alternative
unsigned char value = [ obj physicsType ];
// Set the value
obj.physicsType = MD_OBJECT_PHYSICS_EXACT;
// Alternative
[ obj setPhysicsType:MD_OBJECT_PHYSICS_EXACT ];
