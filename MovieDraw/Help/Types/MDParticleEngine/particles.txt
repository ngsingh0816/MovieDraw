<desc>Returns the particle data array. Each particle is a struct with a double of life (how many frames it has before it gets renewed), 3 floats of position, 3 floats of startPos (the starting position), 3 floats of color, a float of size, and 3 floats of seed (a randomized number between -1 and 1 with 5 digits of precision).</desc>
<example>
MDParticleEngine* obj = //...
// Get the particles
MDParticle* particles = [ obj particles ];
