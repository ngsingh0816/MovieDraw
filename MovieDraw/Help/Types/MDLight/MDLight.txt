<desc>A class that represents a light. There are three different types of light: directional light, point lights and spot lights. Directional lights are like the sun; they seem to be coming from a certain direction, but still illuminate other parts of the scene. Point lights are lights that emit in every direction, and spot lights are point lights but with a restricted emitting angle. These lights have configurable colors, attenuations, and angles.</desc>
<example>
// Create an MDLight
MDLight* obj = [ [ MDLight alloc ] init ];
// Cleanup
[ obj release ];
</example>
