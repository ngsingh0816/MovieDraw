<desc>A class that represents a collection of points that simulate a curve. There need to be at least two points for this to be an actual representation. If there are only two points, the curve is a line connecting the two point. If there are three points, the curve is a circle that goes through all three points. If there are four points, the curve is a Bezier Curve. More than four points is not supported at this time.</desc>
<example>
// Create an MDCurve
MDCurve* obj = [ [ MDCurve alloc ] init ];
// Cleanup
[ obj release ];
