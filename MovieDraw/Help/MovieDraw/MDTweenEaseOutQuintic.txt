	<name>Function</name>
	<return>
		<type>float</type>
		<desc>An interpolation from 0 to 1 based on time.</desc>
	</return>
	<argument0>
		<type>float</type>
		<name>time</type>
		<desc>A measure of how much time has based going from 0 to 1.</desc>
	</argument0>
</type>
<desc>Interpolates the time argument by easing out quintically and returns that value. It is guaranteed to be 0 when time is 0 and 1 when time is 1. It is modeled by the formula: f(x) = x^5.</desc>
<example>
// Called every frame
static float time = 0;
float value = MDTweenEaseOutQuintic(time);
// Increases time so it will reach 1 regardless of how many FPS it is actually getting
time += 0.1 * MDElapsedTime() * MDFPS() / 1000.0;
